# Sepsis Detection Using LSTM-based Machine Learning Model

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the development of a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** based machine learning model for the early detection of **sepsis** in ICU patients. By leveraging **time-series data** from vital signs and lab results, the model aims to predict sepsis events early, enabling timely intervention and improving patient outcomes.

## Project Description
Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that requires early detection to prevent severe complications. This project aims to address the challenges of **early diagnosis** by building a predictive model using **LSTM networks**, which excel in analyzing sequential and time-series data. The model is trained using the **MIMIC-III Database**, which contains ICU patient records, including **vital signs** and **lab results**.

## Data Collection
The data used in this project comes from the **MIMIC-III Database**, a freely accessible critical care dataset that provides detailed patient information, including:
- **Demographics**
- **Vital signs**
- **Laboratory results**

The data is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize continuous variables, and address **class imbalance** using techniques like **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

## Methodology
### 1. Data Preprocessing
   - Handling missing data through **imputation**.
   - **Normalization** of continuous variables.
   - **Outlier removal** to maintain data quality.
   - Use of **SMOTE** to balance class distribution for sepsis detection.

### 2. Feature Engineering
   - Extract key features from vital signs and lab results.
   - Segment data into **time-series intervals** (e.g., 6-hour windows) to capture trends over time.

### 3. Model Development
   - **LSTM model** is used to capture temporal dependencies in the data.
   - The model includes **input layers**, **LSTM layers**, and a **dense output layer** for classification.

### 4. Model Evaluation
   - The model is evaluated using metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **AUC (Area Under the Curve)**.

### 5. Integration into Clinical Systems
   - The trained model can be integrated into **clinical decision support systems** for real-time prediction of sepsis in ICU settings.
